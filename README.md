# French Manga Downloader

This project is meant for educational purposes only, I'm here not responsible for how third parties use it.

I created this project to solve a personal issue and so it's not intended nor built for others to use or contribute. Maybe in the future, I'll make an upgraded version of this.

# The goal

I wanted to read mangas in French, but official websites were scarce and my favourite mangas were only translated by the awesome manga community. Since I wanted to read them offline and without ads and pop-ups I made a web scraper to download mangas from a French website.

You can read more about this project in [this article that I wrote](https://dev.to/reinaldoassis/coding-a-manga-downloader-with-nodejs-3554). Bye.
